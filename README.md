# CSE-210-Project-3
	This project is used for taking words from a list and finding out the amount of times they are in the list. 
	I beleive the things that I did best was the functions. I have really come to like the function creation and the uses of them with objects.
 	I believe that I could have made some changes to the redundency in the code. I.E. when I made the read file I used a count variable and reset it every time when instead I could have simply used ++. 
	I have never really used maps before and had some challenges trying to use them. My original thought was to use an array to store the values and then check each element in the array with the list but the time complexity of that would be much worse. 
 	The use of maps can be very useful for organization and functionality.
	When I code I tend to work with one part at a time and make sure I fully understand how and why it works and try to document along the way.
